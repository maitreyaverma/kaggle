# Kaggle Intermediate Machine Learning
they are teaching code for the housing price competition, lets try to learn that.
## Exercise Introduction
* reading csv as dataframe and then create new dataframe with particular columns
* random forest models
* sklearn - train test split and model metrics - mean absolute error
* predicting using that model 
## Missing Values
* filtering values which are not numbers
* dropping na columns - isany() in a column of dataframe
* imputation - if there is any na value, then we can use imputer to use a mean value
## Categorical Variables
* using categorical variables to use for textual data when not having the numbers
* using LabelEncoder for that purpose
* one-hot-encoding
## Pipelines
* Using pipeline for smooth training and stuff
* add pre preocessing step in pipeling and then pass data directly through pipeline
## Cross Validation
* using cross validation for model
* graphing and choosing the best parameter
## XGBoost
* using xgboost library to make better predictions
## Data Leakage
* existience of leakage in training data
